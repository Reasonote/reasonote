# 🎉 Reasonote Updates: Better Podcasts & More! 🎉

Hey Reasonote community! 👋 We've got some exciting updates to share with you this week. We've been focusing on improving your podcast experience and making some behind-the-scenes improvements.

## 🆕 What's New:

1. 🎧 **Podcast Queue**: Create your own learning playlist! Add interesting topics to your queue and keep learning, just like in your favorite streaming service. We've also added two new "Skip Buttons" to jump to the next podcast in your queue.

2. 📱 **Background Playback**: Keep learning even when you switch tabs or turn off your phone screen. Use your device's media playback buttons for easy control on-the-go.

3. 🎛️ **Improved Podcast Controls**: 
   - Enhanced speed indicator
   - Prominent queue icon on the right side
   - Optimized overall layout for better usability

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes Improvements:
- AI now correctly saves your self-attested skill level (check in Settings)
- When viewing a specific skill, the AI properly saves the topics you want to study
- Various under-the-hood updates for smooth and secure operation
