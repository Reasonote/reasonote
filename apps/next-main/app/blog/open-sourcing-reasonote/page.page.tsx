              Most "online learning" still feels like reading a textbook in a web browser.
              As lifelong learners and curious individuals, we've observed that current learning platforms generally fall into two categories:
              1. **Pre-made courses** offering complete but inflexible learning experiences
                  - Well-structured but fixed curricula that rarely align with individual needs
                  - Material often lacks personal relevance, resulting in single-digit completion rates
              2. **Chatbots and AI assistants** providing unstructured, user-led learning
                  - Personalized but lacking structured progression
                  - Difficult to track learning progress
                  - Limited mechanisms for retention and assessment

              We think learning can be the best of both worlds -- structured, but dynamic. Individualized, but grounded.
              We wanted something better -- so we built it.
              And today, we're making that code public.

              **3. Learn & review.** It serves activities (Flashcards, MCQs, Cloze Cards, AI Roleplays, and more) and schedules reviews along the graph so you study what matters most.
              **4. Take it with you.** Hit *Generate podcast* and listen on your commute.

              Here's what sets Reasonote apart:
              - **Smart learning pathways:** We map out how concepts connect and build on each other, so you always learn things in the right order.
              - **Intelligent review scheduling:** We remember what you know and what you don't, prioritizing reviews based on how concepts relate to each other, not just isolated facts.
              - **Beyond simple memorization:** We offer activities that develop your ability to analyze, evaluate, and create - not just memorize facts.
              - **Everything links back to source:** Every activity connects directly back to your original materials, so you can verify information and see it in context.
              - **Listen and learn:** Turn any document into a personalized podcast that focuses on what matters most to your learning goals.
              - **Extends to fit your needs:** Our plugin architecture lets you create custom activity types, or connect to other learning tools.
              - **Truly open:** The entire codebase is open source, so you can inspect it, modify it, run it yourself, and keep complete control of your learning data.

              We believe learning is a fundamental right and everyone should have access to high-quality education regardless of resources. Open-sourcing Reasonote is a step toward this vision, allowing people to run the project themselves and maintain ownership of their learning data.
              We're concerned about data usage in privately-owned platforms. Such ownership creates opportunities for data monetization, potentially leading to predatory advertising and misaligned incentives where companies prioritize keeping users on the platform rather than optimizing their learning experience.
