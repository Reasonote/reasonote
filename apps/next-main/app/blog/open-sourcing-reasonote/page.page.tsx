              Education today faces fundamental challenges that limit learner potential:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              
              ### Traditional Education's Limitations
              
              - One-size-fits-none curriculum that moves at the same pace regardless of individual understanding
              - Impersonal learning environments due to high student-teacher ratios
              - Limited "why" context where students are told what to learn but rarely why it matters
              - Fear of failure that discourages experimentation and first-principles thinking
              
              <br/>
              ### Current EdTech Shortcomings
              
              Having been both learners and teachers, we've observed that learning platforms fall into two categories: **pre-made courses** that offer complete but inflexible learning experiences, and **chatbots or AI assistants** that provide unstructured, user-led learning but lack any structured progression.

              We think learning can be the best of both worlds -- structured, but dynamic, individualized yet grounded. Mastery and curiosity thriving together.

            Key Innovations That Make Reasonote Unique

              ### 1. Fully Generative, Grounded In Sources
              
              Unlike traditional educational platforms that rely on pre-written content, every aspect of Reasonote's learning experience is dynamically generated by AI, while staying grounded in your source material. This includes the curriculum structure, explanations, examples, practice activities, and personalized feedback - all generated from and validated against your original content. The AI adapts the content and difficulty based on your goals and interests, creating an individualized learning journey that evolves with you while ensuring accuracy to the source material.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ### 2. Skill Tree & DAG-SRS-1 Algorithm
              
              Unlike Anki, Duolingo, or Quizlet ‚Äî we map prerequisite relationships between concepts (as a Directed Acyclic Graph) and combine this with spaced repetition. This means you'll learn concepts in-order, and when you're ready. For instance ‚Äî you'll learn the concept of ***velocity*** before the concept of ***acceleration***, because our system knows it's a prerequisite and you're prepared.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              While "Spaced Repetition for Skill Sequencing" is a well-studied method for information retention, most implementations are concept-specific and don't account for prerequisite relationships between skills. Our DAG-SRS-1 algorithm combines prerequisite relationships and performance scores to determine the best next skill to learn, ensuring a logical learning progression.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              ### 3. AI-Generated Activity Abstraction
              
              We've gone beyond basic flashcards to prevent "overfitting" in learning. Our system generates eight different activity types (roleplay, sequencing, term-matching, etc.) that move past memorization to ensure deeper conceptual understanding.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Developers can create new activity types by specifying three components:

              - A generator (TS) that creates the activity
              - A renderer (React) that displays it
              - A grader (TS) that evaluates responses
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Each component has access to AI calls to make the experience as interactive as desired.

              We believe systematic improvements to education will improve the world. As such, education is far too important to be locked behind proprietary walls. We've seen the bad that came from "enshittification", and we've seen the good that came from Wikipedia and other open-source tools. We want to build a robust future for AI-powered learning.
              
              We believe education should foster both mastery of existing knowledge and the curiosity to question it - creating learners who can stand at the frontier of knowledge and then push it forward through first-principles thinking.
              
              Finally, we believe that making the product community-driven can give us a much broader perspective, to ensure the product is useful in a wide array of domains and circumstances. This will help us discover use cases we haven't yet considered.
