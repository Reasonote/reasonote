            Why We're Doing This
          </Txt>

          <MuiMarkdownDefault>
            {trimLines(`
              Having been both learners and teachers, we've observed that learning platforms fall into two categories: **pre-made courses** that offer complete but inflexible learning experiences, and **chatbots or AI assistants** that provide unstructured, user-led learning but lack any structured progression.

              We think learning can be the best of both worlds -- structured, but dynamic, individualized yet grounded. Mastery and curiosity thriving together. We wanted something better -- so we built it.

              And it is open! Some of the reasons we're doing this:

              - **Access for all.** Learning is a fundamental right, and everyone should have access to high-quality education regardless of their ability to pay. Open-sourcing Reasonote lets anyone run the project themselves.
              - **Data ownership.** Privately owned platforms will monetize your data, potentially leading to predatory advertising and misaligned incentives where firms prioritize keeping users on the platform rather than optimizing their learning experience. With open source, you can host Reasonote yourself and keep full control of your own data.
              - **Community-powered growth.** Our vision is broad, and we need your help to reach it: adding features for your specific use cases, translating the interface, and pushing the frontier of what adaptive learning can do.

              - **Smart learning pathways:** We map out how concepts connect and build on each other, so you always learn things in the right order.
              - **Intelligent review scheduling:** We remember what you know and what you don't, prioritizing reviews based on how concepts relate to each other, not just isolated facts.
              - **Beyond simple memorization:** We offer activities that develop your ability to analyze, evaluate, and create - not just memorize facts.
              - **Everything links back to source:** Every activity connects directly back to your original materials, so you can verify information and see it in context.
              - **Listen and learn:** Turn any document into a personalized podcast that focuses on what matters most to your learning goals.
              - **Extends to fit your needs:** Our plugin architecture lets you create custom activity types, or connect to other learning tools.
              - **Truly open:** The entire codebase is open source, so you can inspect it, modify it, run it yourself, and keep complete control of your learning data.
