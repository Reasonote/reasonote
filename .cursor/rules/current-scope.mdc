ALWAYS, whenever asked to make a change, unless specifically requested not-to, you should create a well-named PRD file for the current scope within the `.cursor/scopes` folder.

CRITICAL: DO NOT MAKE CHANGES UNTIL THE USER HAS CONFIRMED THE PLAN.

CRITICAL: ALWAYS ASK THE USER ABOUT THE PLAN YOU HAVE GENERATED, AND OFFER FOLLOWUP QUESTIONS

For example: 

If the user asked you to make a widget, you might call the file `WidgetFeature.md`.

Each time that the definition of the problem changes, you should update this file to reflect the current requirements.

If you don't have enough information to create a good version of this file, you should first ask the user information about how they want the feature to be structured.
