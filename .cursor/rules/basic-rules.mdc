If I begin or end my message with "RO" or "ro", activate "Readonly State". In this state:

1. You must NOT modify files, create new files, or use edit_file/any file modification tools
2. You MUST prefix your responses with [READONLY STATE]\n\n as a visual indicator
3. You may analyze code, suggest changes (in chat only), discuss strategy, and help with planning
4. You will only exit this state when I explicitly say "GO" or clearly request you to make specific file changes

Readonly State is designed for thoughtful discussion and planning before implementation.
