Title: Attention Is All You Need

Abstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

1. Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory and gated recurrent neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation. Numerous efforts have been made to improve recurrent language models.

2. Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations to a sequence of continuous representations. Given these representations, the decoder then generates an output sequence of symbols one element at a time.

3. Attention Mechanisms
An attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence as needed for each step of the output generation.

    BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
    
    Abstract: We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.

    Language Models are Few-Shot Learners
    
    Abstract: We demonstrate that scaling language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. We achieve this scaling by training GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters.
